# Azure DevOps Terraform CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Tools used
- **Terraform Development**: Wrote Terraform configurations from scratch to define and provision Azure resources.
- **Version Control**: Set up Azure Repos as the Git repository to manage and version-control the codebase.
- **Git Workflow**: Configured a workflow to push updates to Azure Repos, enabling team collaboration and code management.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Designed and implemented Azure Pipelines to automate infrastructure deployment. The pipeline triggers on every push to the Azure Repos branch, ensuring that changes are automatically built and deployed.

## Description
In this project, I developed a fully automated solution to streamline the deployment of Azure infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. By integrating Terraform and Azure DevOps, I implemented a CI/CD pipeline that deploys infrastructure on every push to a Git-based Azure Repos branch. 
This project showcases my ability to design, build, and manage cloud infrastructure with automation, efficiency, and scalability.
